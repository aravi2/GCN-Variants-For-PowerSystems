Impedance-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (IA-GCN)
The Impedance-Aware Graph Convolutional Network (IA-GCN) is a novel architecture designed to enhance voltage estimation in electrical distribution networks. By integrating the impedance characteristics directly into the graph convolution process, IA-GCN provides a more nuanced understanding of the network's topology and electrical properties, leading to more accurate predictions.

Introduction
Voltage estimation is crucial for the efficient and reliable operation of electrical distribution networks. Traditional approaches often overlook the complex interplay between network topology and line impedances. The IA-GCN model addresses this gap by incorporating impedance information, improving the accuracy of voltage estimation tasks.
